There are different ways for getting started, depending on what you want to do.
Unfortunately, documentation is lacking for all of them. At some point I want to provide tutorials the following use-cases.
Evaluate existing protocols in a virtual environment. Evaluate existing attacks in a virtual environment. Search attacks against existing protocols using reinforcement learning. Specification of protocols. Specification of attack spaces. If you want to start now, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me for support.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://pkel.github.io/cpr/docs/prologue/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pkel.github.io/cpr/docs/prologue/faq/</guid><description>Proof-of-stake, do you plan support? #
I have not tried to specify proof-of-stake protocols in CPR. My intuition is that some variants of proof-of-stake could be represented with no or only small changes to the current virtual environment. E.g., access to local clock might be sufficient. We could also add support for verifiable random functions (VRFs) and verifiable delay functions (VDFs).
However, this project already has a lot of loose ends.</description></item></channel></rss>
