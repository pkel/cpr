Having talked about our [model for virtual protocol
executions](../virtual-environment) and about [how we specify
protocols](../protocol-specification), we can proceed with the
description of the network simulator. Like before, we use Python as
pseudocode to describe important details. The code snippets are
optimized for readability not speed. The real simulator is implemented
in a compiled language to achieve good performance.

## Inputs

`n: int` defines the number of nodes, `range(n)` addresses the
individual nodes.

`neighbours(i: int) -> int list` defines the outgoing network
connections of each node. If node `42` decides to share a block, the
simulator will send this block to the nodes returned by
`neighbours(42)`.

`message_delay(src: int, dst: int) -> float` defines the message
propagation delays. If node `42` sends a block to node `7` at time `t`,
the simulator will deliver the block to node `7` at time `t +
message_delay(42, 7)`. The function does not have to be
deterministic; it can model probability distributions. If the function
returns `float('inf')` the message will not be delivered.

`roots` and `validity` define the structure of the blockchain as
discussed in [the section on protocol
specifications](../protocol-specification). The simulator rejects
invalid blocks.

`node(i: int) -> tuple[init, update, mining]` defines the behaviour of nodes
as discussed in the [the section on protocol
specifications](../protocol-specification). In the simplest case, when
all nodes are honest, `node(i)` for any `i` returns the tree functions
`init`, `update`, and `mining` as defined in the protocol specification.
In attack scenarios, `node(i)` returns nonconforming functions for the
malicious nodes.

`mining_delay() -> float` and `select_miner() -> int` model
proof-of-work difficulty and hash-rates of the nodes. `mining_delay()`
defines the time between consecutive mining events. It is typically a
random function returning independent and exponentially distributed
values. `select_miner()` defines which node is successful at a
particular mining event. It is typically a random function which selects
nodes based on their relative hash-rate.

### Example

We provide an intuition about the simulator inputs by walking through a
realistic (but still simplified) example scenario. We consider [Nakamoto
consensus]({{< protocol "nakamoto" >}}) as it is deployed in Bitcoin.
The following table shows mining statistics for the last 7 days before
Dec. 14 2022. We got it from
[blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools).

| Miner / Pool | Relative Hash-Rate | Blocks Mined |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Foundry USA  | 24,817%            | 271          |
| AntPool      | 20,147%            | 220          |
| F2Pool       | 15,110%            | 165          |
| Binance Pool | 13,736%            | 150          |
| ViaBTC       | 10,440%            | 114          |
| Braiins Pool | 5,311%             | 58           |
| Poolin       | 2,473%             | 27           |
| BTC.com      | 1,923%             | 21           |
| Luxor        | 1,648%             | 18           |
| Mara Pool    | 1,465%             | 16           |
| Ultimus      | 0,641%             | 7            |
| SBI Crypto   | 0,641%             | 7            |
| BTC M4       | 0,366%             | 4            |
| Titan        | 0,275%             | 3            |
| Unknown      | rest, about 1%     | 11           |

We observe that there are 14 big and identifiable miners. The other
participants' hash rates sum up to about 1%. In our simplified scenario
we combine the unknown participants into a single node. Hence we end up
with `n = 15`.

1092 blocks have been mined over the past 7 days, implying an average
block interval of about 554 seconds. Individual block intervals are
exponentially distributed. To meet the average block interval, we scale
the distribution by factor 554 and let `mining_delay()` do the sampling.
`select_miner()` returns a random node according to the hash-rate
distribution in the table.

Regarding the communication, me make a another simplification. We assume
that all nodes are connected to each other and that blocks propagate in
6 seconds with a uniformly distributed jitter of Â± 2 seconds.

We further assume that all nodes are honest and that [the specification
of Nakamoto consensus]({{< protocol "nakamoto" >}}) is provided in the
Python module `nakamoto`.

```python
import nakamoto  # protocol specification
from numpy import random


def mining_delay():
    return random.exponential(scale=554)


def select_miner():
    hash_rates = [0.24817, 0.20147, ..., 0.00275, 0.01]  # from table
    return random.choice(range(n), p=hash_rates)


def neighbours(i):
    return [x for x in range(n) if x != i]


def message_delay(src, dst):
    return 6 + random.uniform(low=-2, high=2)


def roots():
    return nakamoto.roots()


def validity(block):
    return nakamoto.validity(block)


def node(i):
    return (nakamoto.init, nakamoto.update, nakamoto.mining)
```

## Concurrent programming

We describe the simulator as a concurrent program. We thereby follow the
conventions introduced by [Python's `asyncio`][asyncio]. We use the
language primitives `async` and `await` as well as the `asyncio` functions
`sleep`, `create_task` and `run`. We assume the following import at the
beginning of all our concurrent programs.

[asyncio]: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/asyncio-task.html

```python
from asyncio import sleep, create_task, run
```

We shortly summarize the semantics:
- `async def f(): ...` turns function `f` into a coroutine. `f()` immediately
returns an *Awaitable*, that is, an object representing the potentially
unfinished evaluation of the underlying function.
- `await x` waits for the Awaitable `x` to complete and returns the
result of the underlying function.
- `sleep(x)` creates an awaitable that completes after `x` seconds.
- `create_task(x)` schedules awaitable `x` for completion in the background,
even if `x` is never *<<awaited>>*.

Our concurrent programs are not parallel. Computations take place
sequentially in a single thread. `await` does not block the whole thread
but only the current coroutine---other Awaitables can be evaluated
concurrently.

We will regularly write statements of the form *wait n seconds, then do
this or that*. For brevity, we introduce a short wrapper function that
does exactly that. Note that we use `create_task` to ensure that
`fun()` is completed even if `delay(n, fun)` is not awaited.

```python
async def delay(seconds, fun, *args, **kwargs):
    await sleep(seconds)
    task = create_task(fun(*args, **kwargs))
    result = await task
    return result
```

{{< code-figure >}}
```pycon
>>> async def f(x):
...     """print argument prefixed with current time"""
...     print(f"{now()}: {x}")
...
>>> async def main():
...     f("a")
...     delay(0, f, "b")
...     delay(1, f, "c")
...     delay(60, f, "d")
...     sleep(10)
...     delay(30, f, "e")
...     f("g")
...
>>> run(main())
07:42:00: a
07:42:00: b
07:42:01: c
07:42:10: g
07:42:40: e
07:43:00: d
```

Python example demonstrating the use of concurrent programming.
The execution was started at 7:42:00.

Helper co-routine `delay_until`. Active waiting; easy to follow but too
much overhead in practice.

```python
async def delay_until(prop, fun, *args, **kwargs):
    if prop():
        return fun(*args, **kwargs)
    else:
        return await delay_until(prop, fun, *args, **kwargs)
```

Example script.

```python
state = 0
delay_until(lambda: state > 0, f, "a")
f("b")
delay(10, lambda: state=1)
```

Script output if executed at 7:42:00.

07:42:00: b

```

## Naive real time simulation

TODO. High level description of the simulator as concurrent program with
waiting.


Initialization.
- Initialize empty Block DAG.
- Add `roots()` blocks to the DAG. Make visible to all nodes.
- Initialize node IDs 1 ... `n`.
- Initialize node states with `node(i)["init"](roots)`.

In background run proof-of-work loop.
- wait `mining_delay()` seconds
- obtain node id from `i = select_miner()`
- obtain block draft from `node(i)["mining"]()`
- convert block draft into block, set pow property, check validity
- if valid, deliver block to node `i` with source `"mining"`.
- else, delete block
- re-enter the loop.

Delivery. Arguments `block`, `i`, `source`.
- ensure that block is delivered at most once and in dag-imposed order
  * wait until all parents are visible
  * if block not yet visible continue, else abort delivery
- make block visible to node `i`
- recall old state `old_state = state[i]`
- obtain update `upd = node(i)["update"](old_state, block, source)`
- store new state `state[i] = upd.state`
- handle communication. Node returned request to share messages in
`upd.share`. For each of these messages do `send(m)`.
- handle block appends w/o proof-of-work. Node returned request to
append blocks in `upd.append`. For each of these blocks do `append(m,
i)`.

Communication. Function `send(block, src)`.
- Get neighbours of node `src`.
- For each neighbor `dst`, concurrently do
  * wait for `message_delay(src, dst)` seconds
  * do `deliver(block, dst, "network"`

Block appends w/o proof-of-work. Function `append(block_draft, src)`.
  * Convert block draft into global block. Reuse existing blocks if
  possible.
  * Set pow property to false
  * check block validity
  * if valid, do `deliver(src, block, "append")`


```python
dag = DAG()
blocks = [dag.add(b) for b in roots()]
state = [None for _ in range(n)]
for b in blocks:
    for i in range(n):
        dag.make_visible(b, i)
for i in range(n):
    init, _update, _mining = node(i)
    with dag.partial_visibility(i):
        state[i] = init(blocks)

# proof-of-work loop
while true:
    wait_seconds(mining_delay())
    i = select_miner()
    _init, _update, mining = node(i)
    with dag.partial_visibility(i):
        draft = mining()
    block = dag.add(draft)
    block.pow = True
    if validity(block):
        deliver(block, i, "proof-of-work")
    else:
        dag.remove(block)


def deliver(block, i, event):
    # deliver block in DAG-order
    wait_until(
        lambda: all([dag.is_visible(b, i) for b in block.parents()])
    )

    # deliver block once
    if dag.is_visible(block, i):
        return
    dag.make_visible(block, i)

    # simulate node-action
    _init, update, _mining = node(i)
    with dag.partial_visibility(i):
        upd = update(state[i], block, event)

    # handle state update
    state[i] = upd.state

    # handle communication
    for m in upd.share:
        for dst in neighbours(node):
            after_seconds(
                message_delay(node, dst),
                lambda: deliver(dst, m, "network"),
            )

    # handle non-proof-of-work appends
    for draft in upd.append:
        block = dag.add(draft)
        block.pow = False
        if validity(block):
            deliver(block, node, "append")
```
