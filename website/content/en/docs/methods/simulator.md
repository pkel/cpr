Having talked about our [model for virtual protocol
executions](../virtual-environment) and about [how we specify
protocols](../protocol-specification), we can proceed with the
description of the network simulator. Like before, we use Python as
pseudocode to describe important details. The code snippets are
optimized for readability not speed. The real simulator is implemented
in a compiled language to achieve good performance.

## Inputs

`n: int` defines the number of nodes, `range(n)` addresses the
individual nodes.

`neighbours(i: int) -> int list` defines the outgoing network
connections of each node. If node `42` decides to share a block, the
simulator will send this block to the nodes returned by
`neighbours(42)`.

`message_delay(src: int, dst: int) -> float` defines the message
propagation delays. If node `42` sends a block to node `7` at time `t`,
the simulator will deliver the block to node `7` at time `t +
message_delay(42, 7)`. The function does not have to be
deterministic; it can model probability distributions. If the function
returns `float('inf')` the message will not be delivered.

`roots` and `validity` define the structure of the blockchain as
discussed in [the section on protocol
specifications](../protocol-specification). The simulator rejects
invalid blocks.

`node(i: int) -> tuple[init, update, mining]` defines the behaviour of nodes
as discussed in the [the section on protocol
specifications](../protocol-specification). In the simplest case, when
all nodes are honest, `node(i)` for any `i` returns the tree functions
`init`, `update`, and `mining` as defined in the protocol specification.
In attack scenarios, `node(i)` returns nonconforming functions for the
malicious nodes.

`mining_delay() -> float` and `miner() -> int` model proof-of-work
difficulty and hash-rates of the nodes. `mining_delay()` defines the
time between consecutive mining events. It is typically a random
function returning independent and exponentially distributed values.
`miner()` defines which node is successful at a particular mining event.
It is typically a random function which selects nodes based on their
relative hash-rate.

### Example

We provide an intuition about the simulator inputs by walking through a
realistic (but still simplified) example scenario. We consider [Nakamoto
consensus]({{< protocol "nakamoto" >}}) as it is deployed in Bitcoin.
The following table shows mining statistics for the last 7 days before
Dec. 14 2022. We got it from
[blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools).

| Miner / Pool | Relative Hash-Rate | Blocks Mined |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Foundry USA  | 24,817%            | 271          |
| AntPool      | 20,147%            | 220          |
| F2Pool       | 15,110%            | 165          |
| Binance Pool | 13,736%            | 150          |
| ViaBTC       | 10,440%            | 114          |
| Braiins Pool | 5,311%             | 58           |
| Poolin       | 2,473%             | 27           |
| BTC.com      | 1,923%             | 21           |
| Luxor        | 1,648%             | 18           |
| Mara Pool    | 1,465%             | 16           |
| Ultimus      | 0,641%             | 7            |
| SBI Crypto   | 0,641%             | 7            |
| BTC M4       | 0,366%             | 4            |
| Titan        | 0,275%             | 3            |
| Unknown      | rest, about 1%     | 11           |

We observe that there are 14 big and identifiable miners. The other
participants' hash rates sum up to about 1%. In our simplified scenario
we combine the unknown participants into a single node. Hence we end up
with `n = 15`.

1092 blocks have been mined over the past 7 days, implying an average
block interval of about 554 seconds. Individual block intervals are
exponentially distributed. To meet the average block interval, we scale
the distribution by factor 554 and let `mining_delay()` do the sampling.
`miner()` returns a random node according to the hash-rate distribution
in the table.

Regarding the communication, me make a another simplification. We assume
that all nodes are connected to each other and that blocks propagate in
6 seconds with a uniformly distributed jitter of Â± 2 seconds.

We further assume that all nodes are honest and that [the specification
of Nakamoto consensus]({{< protocol "nakamoto" >}}) is provided in the
Python module `nakamoto`.

```python
import nakamoto  # protocol specification
from numpy import random


def mining_delay():
    return random.exponential(scale=554)


def miner():
    hash_rates = [0.24817, 0.20147, ..., 0.00275, 0.01]  # from table
    return random.choice(range(n), p=hash_rates)


def neighbours(i):
    return [x for x in range(n) if x != i]


def message_delay(src, dst):
    return 6 + random.uniform(low=-2, high=2)


def roots():
    return nakamoto.roots()


def validity(block):
    return nakamoto.validity(block)


def node(i):
    return (nakamoto.init, nakamoto.update, nakamoto.mining)
```

(implementation detail, nice to know but maybe not fully describe this
here)

* Discrete event simulation
* Time-ordered queue of future events
* Infinite loop consuming & handling first event in the queue
