## Intuition

The "original" proof-of-work consensus protocol. Miners build a linear
chain of blocks (blockchain). Each block refers to exactly one parent
block by including the parents hash. Appending a new block requires a
proof-of-work. Miners always try to extend the longest chain. The number
of predecessors of a block is called *height*.


## Example

{{< mermaid-figure >}}
```mermaid
graph RL
  classDef orphan opacity:0.5,fill:#eee

  A([h])
  B([h+1])
  CA([h+2]):::orphan
  CB([h+2])
  D([h+3])
  EA([h+4])
  EB([h+4]):::orphan
  F([h+5])
  G([h+6])
  CA --> B --> A
  EB --> D --> CB --> B
  G --> F --> EA --> D

  linkStyle 0,2 opacity:0.5
```
Boxes represent blocks, arrows represent hash-references. Each block has
exactly one parent. Appending a new block requires proof-of-work. The
gray blocks are orphaned.

## Specification

Have a look at [the methodology page for protocol specification]({{< method
"protocol-specification" >}}) to learn how to read this.

### Blockchain

```python
def roots():
    return [Block(height=0, miner=None)]


def validity(b: Block):
    assert len(b.parents()) == 1
    assert b.has_pow()
    assert b.height == b.parents()[0].height + 1
    return True
```

### Node

```python
def init(roots: [Block]):
    return roots[0]


def update(old: Block, new: Block, event: string):
    if event == "mining":
        return Update(state=new, share=[new])
    elif new.height > old.height:
        return Update(state=new)
    else:
        return Update(state=old)


def mining(b: Block):
    return Block(height=b.height + 1, parents=[b], miner=Env.my_id)
```

### Difficulty Adjustment

```python
def progress(b: Block):
    return b.height
```

### Rewards

```python
def reward(b: Block):
    return [Reward(b.miner, 1)]
```

{{< mermaid-figure >}}
```mermaid
graph RL
  classDef orphan opacity:0.5,fill:#eee
  A([1])
  B([1])
  CA([n/a]):::orphan
  CB([1])
  D([1])
  EA([1])
  EB([n/a]):::orphan
  F([1])
  G([1])
  CA --> B --> A
  EB --> D --> CB --> B
  G --> F --> EA --> D

  linkStyle 0,2 opacity:0.5
```
Reward scheme applied to the example blockchain shown above. Each block
on the longest chain assign 1 unit of reward to is miner.
