## Proof-of-stake, do you plan support?

I have not tried to specify proof-of-stake protocols in CPR.
My intuition is that some variants of proof-of-stake could be
represented with no or only small changes to the current virtual
environment. E.g., access to local clock might be sufficient. We could
also add support for verifiable random functions (VRFs) and verifiable
delay functions (VDFs).

However, this project already has a lot of loose ends. Currently I have
no capacity to think about proof-of-stake.

## How can I contact you?

Please don't hesitate. You'll find my mail address in [my GitHub
profile](https://github.com/pkel). For public communication, consider
creating a [new issue](https://github.com/pkel/cpr/issues).
