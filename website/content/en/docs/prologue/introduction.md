## Get started

There are different ways for getting started, depending on what you want to do.

Unfortunately, documentation is lacking for all of them. At some point I
want to provide tutorials the following use-cases.

- Evaluate existing protocols in a virtual environment.
- Evaluate existing attacks in a virtual environment.
- Search attacks against existing protocols using reinforcement learning.
- Specification of protocols.
- Specification of attack spaces.

If you want to start now, don't hesitate to contact
[me](https://github.com/pkel) for support.
